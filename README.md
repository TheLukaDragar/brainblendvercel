Then, months or even years later, the same problem came up again, but you couldn’t remember the answer. You hadn’t saved it, and searching through old emails or chat messages was time-consuming and often unsuccessful.

## So how can we solve this?

Since we’re already used to asking tools like ChatGPT for everything — from quick facts to complex issues — we realized the best way to preserve and reuse valuable knowledge is to **embed it directly into the language model** people are using.

So we asked ourselves: **How can we motivate users to save the helpful information they share with others, and how can we make sure that knowledge stays accessible and easy to find — right where they’re already searching for answers?**

## Our solution

When the model doesn’t have a confident answer, the question can be shared with the community. Community members provide their own answers, which are then evaluated based on:

- **accuracy**
- **completeness**
- **clarity**
- **helpfulness**
- **conciseness**

When multiple answers are submitted, the system **checks for alignment between them** — identifying common ground and reconciling differing opinions or interpretations. This ensures that the final result isn’t just the most popular or loudest voice, but a **balanced, high-quality, community-validated answer**. This answer is then used to train and improve the model.

## What does this mean in practice?

Next time someone asks the same or a similar question, the model will already know the answer — no need to repeat the question or go looking for it again.

## The benefits:

- ✅ No more repeating the same questions – the model remembers past answers.  
- 🚀 A constantly improving, smarter LLM.  
- 🌐 A shared knowledge base, where everyone’s input makes the system better.

This is a **smart collaboration between humans and AI**, where each answer becomes a building block for a better and more helpful system – and where no knowledge ever gets lost again.
